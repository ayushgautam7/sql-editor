The SQL Editor project is a responsive web application built on ReactJS, facilitating the execution and visualization of SQL queries. The application is structured into four key components:

**Navigation Bar:** Provides easy access to the application through its logo and "SQL Editor" label.

**Table Space:** Features three predefined tables—Customers, Sales, and Students—for reference when crafting SQL queries.

**Editor Space:** Offers a platform for users to input SQL commands. It includes three preloaded queries linked to the respective tables for quick execution, alongside the option for users to run custom SQL queries.

**Output Space:** Displays the results of executed queries, providing users with a clear and visual representation of the query outputs.

The project delivers a user-friendly interface that streamlines the process of writing, executing, and visualizing SQL queries, enhancing the overall user experience in managing and analyzing database information.

**NOTE:** This application is a simulation, lacking syntax validation, and the displayed output doesn't necessarily reflect accurate results.
